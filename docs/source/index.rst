Mosyco Documentation
********************

Welcome to Mosyco's documentation! The following pages outline the first prototype of a Model-/System-Controller architecture as conceived by Breuer [1]_. It is an academic project in the domain of Information Systems, exploring how *self-correcting* models might change model-based business planning.

The project is part of a master's thesis in Information Systems at the `University of Osnabr√ºck <https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html>`_
