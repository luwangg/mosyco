MoSyCo

This is the prototype for a Model-/System-Controller architecture.

Installation:

Requires Python 3.6 or higher. Maybe just install the latest Anaconda.
I also recommend using a virtualenv or conda environment. Then:

1. Clone this repository and change into the directory::

    git clone "https://github.com/vab9/mosyco"
    cd mosyco

2. Install the requirements (takes a while)::

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Running::

    python -m mosyco
